## Requirements

The project uses Grunt for task management. Use of Grunt is optional, but highly recommended.

To use the command-line version of Grunt you will need to install the global [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) module.

Run `npm install -g grunt-cli` if needed


## Setup

You have two options for getting up an running, with or without the Grunt support

**Option 1 -** Without Grunt support:

Clone the repo and get started.

`git clone https://stash.di2e.net/scm/mer/meridian-geo.git`

**Option 2 -** With Grunt Support:

1. Get Grunt's global CLI module. Run `npm install -g grunt-cli`

2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://stash.di2e.net/scm/mer/meridian-geo.git`

3. Change into the project directory: `cd meridian-geo`

4. Run `npm install` to make sure everything is up to date. 

At this point, you will be able to run the Grunt tasks.

*Some Node Modules have been checked into the repo (not a normal best practice),
to help make the transition easier while we check for high-side support for the required modules. 
The node_modules directory will be removed from teh project at a later point, 
when the team is comfortable with the process. In the future, 
developers will be responsible for running `npm install` to get the dependencies.*
